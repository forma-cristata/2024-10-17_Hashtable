- Dynamic sizing with automatic memory management
- Standard array of vectors implementation for efficient collision handling
- Full operator overloading support

### Core Functionality

- Add and remove key-value pairs
- Clear entire hash table
- Check for key existence
- String representation for easy debugging

### Technical Details

Built using modern C++ features including std::vector and std::tuple. Implements proper memory management to prevent leaks. 

### Usage Example

Perfect for implementing menu systems, dictionaries, or any key-value storage needs. Includes comprehensive testing suite to ensure reliability.
